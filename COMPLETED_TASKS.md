# Project: PowerUnityMCP - Completed Tasks

This document summarizes the work completed for the Unity AI Agent project as of 2025-07-19.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Tool Implementation

The initial phase focused on setting up the Unity project and implementing a comprehensive suite of C# tools to act as the agent's "Hands" within the Unity Editor.

### Completed Tasks:

-   **[x] Prepare Unity project directory:** Set up the workspace for development.
-   **[x] Fork and clone the UnityNaturalMCP repository:** Cloned the base project from `https://github.com/notargs/UnityNaturalMCP` into the local workspace.
-   **[x] Confirm `[McpServerTool]` attribute usage:** Verified the existing pattern for tool registration.
-   **[x] Implement new tools in C# using `[McpServerTool]`:**
    -   `StartPlayMode()`
    -   `StopPlayMode()`
    -   `CreateGameObject(name, primitiveType)`
-   **[x] Port all perception/resource tools from `MCPUnityRockstar`:** Adapted and integrated a full suite of perception tools into our project.
    -   `GetSceneHierarchySimple()`: To view the scene object hierarchy.
    -   `GetGameObjectDetails(instanceId)`: To inspect individual GameObjects.
    -   `GetProjectAssets(filter)`: To find assets within the project.
    -   `GetConsoleLogs()`: To read Unity's console output.
    -   `GetMenuItems()`: To discover available editor menu commands.
    -   `GetProjectPackages()`: To list installed packages.
    -   `GetProjectTests()`: To find all unit/integration tests.

All tools have been implemented in `UnityProject/UnityNaturalMCPTest/Assets/Editor/UnityEditorTools.cs` following the established `[McpServerTool]` pattern.
